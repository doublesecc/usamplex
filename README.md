## About
usamplex is a python tool to randomly extract a user defined amount of unique lines from a file.  

This can be used to randomly select x number of unqiue users from a file, and save the extracted and remaining outputs to files.   

The reason that the remaining outputs are added to a file, is in case you want to run the tool again against that.

## Requirements
Install requirements with pip:
``` bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
````
